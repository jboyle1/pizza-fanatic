## Pizza Fanatic

1. INTRODUCTION

This project is a pizza ordering website that will run on CRUD functionality (create, read, update, and delete). The front-end code will display the retrieved data and allow for user input while the back end will manage these requests. This project gave me an even clearer understanding of MySQL query strings and how to create more efficient code. It helped me understand how to implement PHP in a more structured way. This project has improved my approach and procedure for this type of website development. I also learned a lot about XXS attacks and how to implement form input security.
